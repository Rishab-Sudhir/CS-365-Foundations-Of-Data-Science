# CS-365-Foundations-of-Data-Science

All the projects i worked in in CS365.

Topics include: K-means Clustering, Expectation Maximization, DBscan ...

Course Description: This course lays the foundation towards more advanced data-intensive classes, such as
Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Mining. The course provides an understanding of the fundamentals
and the practical implications of concepts. It covers both theoretical skills as well as working/practical
knowledge. It introduces to students to key concepts that are necessary when taking more advanced datascience classes. Therefore, the goal of the class is to provide an understanding of the fundamentals and
the practical implications of concepts such as: tools from probability and statistics, operations on feature
spaces, Markov Chains and random walks, learning from data, classification as well as data-management
techniques such as basics of SQL etc.
